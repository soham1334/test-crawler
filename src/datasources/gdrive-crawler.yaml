# This 'type' MUST match the 'Type' constant exported from your gdrive-crawler.ts
type: gdrive-crawler

# --- Required Configuration ---
# The ID of the Google Drive folder you want to crawl or monitor.
# You can find this ID in the URL when you open a folder in Google Drive (e.g., https://drive.google.com/drive/drive/folders/YOUR_FOLDER_ID)

# --- Authentication (Secure Authentication: 3.3.3.2) ---
# Currently, only 'service_account' is supported.
authType?: service_account

# Service Account Key:
# You must provide your Google Service Account key.
# It is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED to store the JSON key content in an environment variable
# for production environments, rather than directly in this file or a file path.

# Option 1: Provide the JSON key content directly from an environment variable.
# This is the most secure and recommended approach for production.
#serviceAccountKey?: "GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY_JSON" # <<< IMPORTANT: Set this env var

# Option 2: Provide the path to your service account JSON key file.
# Use this only if environment variables are not feasible.
serviceAccountKeyPath: "../path/to/your/service-account-key.json"
