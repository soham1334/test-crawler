# src/datasources/azure-blob-crawler.yaml
# This 'type' MUST match the 'Type' constant exported from your azure-blob-crawler.ts
type: azure-blob-crawler

# --- Required Configuration ---
# The name of the Azure Blob Storage container you want to crawl or monitor.
# This is now optional at the SDK level, but required for actual crawling operations.
containerName?: "your-azure-container-name" # <<< IMPORTANT: Replace with your actual Azure Blob container name

# --- Authentication (Secure Authentication: 3.3.3.2) ---
# You must provide authentication details for your Azure Storage Account.
# It is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED to use environment variables for sensitive information in production.

# Option 1 (Recommended): Provide the Azure Storage Account Connection String.
# This string contains all necessary authentication details (account name, key, endpoint).
# Example: DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName=youraccount;AccountKey=yourkey;EndpointSuffix=core.windows.net
connectionString?: "AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING" # <<< IMPORTANT: Set this env var, or provide actual string

# Option 2 (Alternative): Provide Account Name and Account Key separately.
# Use this if you prefer not to use a full connection string.
# accountName?: "${env.AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME}" # Your Azure Storage Account Name
# accountKey?: "${env.AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_KEY}" Â  # Your Azure Storage Account Key

# --- Optional Configurations for Standard Mode ---
# An optional blob prefix to filter objects when listing (e.g., 'my-folder/', 'logs/2023/').
# Only blobs whose names start with this prefix will be considered.
# prefix: "documents/"

# --- Webhook Mode Configuration (for Azure Event Grid Notifications - Monitoring: 3.3.3.3) ---
# Enable webhook mode for this AzureBlobCrawler instance.
# When true, this instance will expect to receive Azure Event Grid payloads
# and process specific blob changes from them.
webhookMode: true

# Dot-separated path to extract the Blob URL from the incoming webhook payload.
# Azure Event Grid notifications for Blob Storage typically have the URL here.
# Example payload structure: [{ "data": { "url": "https://account.blob.core.windows.net/container/blob.txt" }, "eventType": "Microsoft.Storage.BlobCreated" }]
webhookBlobUrlPath: "data.url" # Assumes Event Grid schema

# Dot-separated path to extract the event type from the incoming webhook payload.
# Common values: 'Microsoft.Storage.BlobCreated', 'Microsoft.Storage.BlobDeleted', etc.
webhookEventTypePath: "eventType" # Assumes Event Grid schema
