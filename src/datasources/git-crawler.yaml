# This 'type' must match the 'Type' constant exported from your git-crawler.ts

type: git-crawler

# The URL of the Git repository you want to clone.
# This is a required field as per your GitCrawlerConfig.
# In webhookMode, this might be overridden by the webhook payload's repo URL.
repoUrl: https://github.com/soham1334/Txt-to-Speech

# The local path where the repository will be cloned.
# This is relative to your project root (where you run 'gs start' or your script).
# Ensure this directory either doesn't exist or is empty, as 'simple-git' clone
# typically expects an empty or non-existent target directory.
# This is a required field as per your GitCrawlerConfig.
localPath: ./tmp/test2

# Optional: The branch to clone. If not specified, 'main' (or 'master') will be used
# as per the DEFAULT_CONFIG in your git-crawler.ts.
# In webhookMode, this might be overridden by the webhook payload's branch.
branch: main

# Optional: The depth of the clone. If not specified, 1 will be used
# for a shallow clone as per the DEFAULT_CONFIG.
# Set to 0 or omit for a full clone (not recommended for large repos without a good reason).
depth: 1

# NEW: Enable webhook mode for this GitCrawler instance.
# When true, this GitCrawler instance will expect to receive webhook payloads
# and process only the changes indicated by the webhook.
webhookMode: true

# Optional: Secret for webhook signature verification.
# If your Git provider (e.g., GitHub) sends a secret, configure it here.
# The GitCrawler's execute method would then use this to verify the signature.
# webhookSecret: ${env.GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET} # Example: read from environment variable
