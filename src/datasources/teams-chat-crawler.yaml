# --- Required Authentication Configuration (OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials Flow) ---
# These credentials are for your Azure AD Application Registration.
# It is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED to store these sensitive values in environment variables
# (e.g., in your Godspeed project's .env file) rather than hardcoding them here.

# Your Azure AD Tenant ID (also known as Directory ID).
tenantId: "${env.TEAMS_TENANT_ID}" # <<< IMPORTANT: Set this env var

# Your Azure AD Application (Client) ID.
clientId: "${env.TEAMS_CLIENT_ID}" # <<< IMPORTANT: Set this env var

# Your Azure AD Application (Client) Secret.
clientSecret: "${env.TEAMS_CLIENT_SECRET}" # <<< IMPORTANT: Set this env var

# REMOVED: axiosServiceInstanceName as we are not using the Axios plugin

# --- Optional Configurations for Standard Mode ---
# Optional: A specific Teams Online Meeting ID to fetch chat transcripts for.
# This is used when webhookMode is false.
# meetingId: "your_teams_meeting_id"

# Required if meetingId is used in standard mode: The User ID (or UPN) of a user
# who owns or created the meeting. This is necessary for the Graph API path.
# userIdForMeetings: "user@yourdomain.com"

# --- Webhook Mode Configuration ---
# Enable webhook mode for this TeamsChatCrawler instance.
# When true, this instance will expect to receive webhook payloads (e.g., from a custom
# Azure Logic App/Function triggered by Teams events) and process them.
webhookMode: true

# Optional: Dot-separated path to extract the Teams Meeting ID from the incoming webhook payload.
# Example: If your webhook payload is { "event": { "meeting": { "id": "meeting_id_here" } } },
# you would set this to "event.meeting.id".
# webhookMeetingIdPath: "data.meetingId"

# Optional: Dot-separated path to extract the Teams Chat ID (threadId) directly from the incoming webhook payload.
# If the webhook provides the chat ID directly, this is preferred over meetingId.
# webhookChatIdPath: "data.chatId"
